### Challenges Addressed by AMEXLearn 🌐

#### Bridging the Financial Literacy Gap 🌟

At AMEXLearn, we bridge the gap between financial literacy and the financial habits of today's youth. Our mission is to empower individuals, with the knowledge and tools needed to make informed financial decisions, break the cycle of doom spending, and secure a financially stable future.

#### Gen Z: Thin Wallets, Expensive Tastes 💸🎯
Many young people with thin wallets often fall prey to overspending in a world where instant gratification is at our fingertips. Despite their expensive tastes, Gen Z faces challenges in managing finances and frequently lives paycheck to paycheck.

#### The Financial Literacy Challenge 📉📚
India presents a paradox where 75% of the population is literate, but only 24% are financially literate. This disparity leads to extreme financial behaviors—either overspending or oversaving. In BRICS nations, financial literacy remains a critical challenge.

#### Shocking Statistics 📊

- 💰 **Unclaimed Wealth**: ₹18,830 crores are lying unclaimed in Indian banks as of 2019, belonging to individuals who may have passed away or have no heirs.
- 🏦 **Lost Insurance Funds**: By 2020, ₹24,580 crores remained unclaimed in Indian insurance companies.
- 📉 **Financial Mismanagement**: 72% of Indians lack awareness of how much to save or invest for financial security.

#### Traditional Financial Guidance 📈💡
Many rely on family or friends for financial advice, with budgeting remaining unfamiliar to millennials. Parents and elders often serve as de facto financial advisors, highlighting the need for structured financial education.
